the tiny url maker 

working --- 

reqs -- 

database - 
    - redis for databse can be used 
    - mongodb (a seperate db and a collection inside it)
    - a hashing algorithm to make the url hash 
        - no collision should be there 

Front end - 
    - a url maker (input field ) 
    - give url (copy url)


backend - 
    - take the url convert to hash 
    - and map the hash to url 
    - use the function to map the hash to url 

for hashing of the values we pre create the hash and store in the redis list and take it store it in redis set
like 10 of them one of them pops out we store them in them mapper redis hash then generate again 
the set dataset will tale care of the collision problem and pre generation keeps the enough time for collision handling 




make the front end to feed the value in database
