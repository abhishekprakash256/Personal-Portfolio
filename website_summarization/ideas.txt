-- Use a small Language model to summarize the webiste 
-- Make a webcrawler to get the data from the website 
-- fetch the data in the model and then summarize it through the model 


-- small language model like phi-3 
-- google bert 
-- Use Python libraries like requests for fetching web pages and BeautifulSoup or lxml for parsing HTML content.
   These libraries help you extract text and other relevant information from web pages.

-- testing will be crucial phase as the 


Tips for Effective Testing:
     - Diverse Inputs: Test with diverse texts to ensure your model generalizes well across different domains and writing styles.

     - Edge Cases: Include edge cases such as very short or very long texts to check how well your model handles them.

     - Validation Set: Reserve a subset of your data as a validation set during model development to monitor performance and avoid overfitting.




the models best for summarization -- 

In conclusion, for summarization tasks, models like BERT-based variants, 
GPT-Neo, BART, and PEGASUS are well-regarded and have been successfully 
applied in various research and commercial applications. 
The choice should align with your specific needs regarding summarization quality, 
computational efficiency, and ease of integration.










The implemenattion 

The scrambing ideas for the the machine learning addition to the website as the hosting machine will be very expensive for the full machine
-- use two instance , one for hsoting the instance , one for the GPU support in aws -- G4, G5, P4 instance
-- these machine have GPU with choosing the ubuntu cuda installed images




-- I can use SSH to work on the machine
-- the other machine can talk to the GPU machine GRPC web client for bidiretional communication
-- aws lambda can be used for machine sleeping and waking up calls


-- For the code as insfrastructure I can use combination of terraform and ansible to deploy the code and run the production machine
-- grpc protocals can be use to fetch the data from one machine to other machine



reqs --

-- pip install transformers

for the LLM and ML tasks

-- the hugging face models can be a starting point to deep dive
-- LLM caching for faster responses
-- using langchain to build the models
-- using the SLM
